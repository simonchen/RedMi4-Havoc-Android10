GCam requires Google Play Services to run, meaning that it will crash if you try to run it on a phone without GApps. To use GCam, you can't go fully "google free" (GCam itself is a Google product).

microG:

You can use microG, an open-source re-implementation of Google's proprietary libraries. Simply install microG's Service Core app and GCam will work.

Gcam Services Provider: (*Recommended!!!*)

The other alternative is to use the Gcam Services Provider app that "simulates" what GCam needs to run. Download the apk here and visit the project's Github for more information.
